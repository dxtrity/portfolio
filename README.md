Welcome to *The Gear Programming Language Documentation*. We hope you'll stay. The Gear programming language helps you write more reliable code much more efficiently. Gear is a carefully crafted powertool that embodies constructs from your favourite languages like C. While ensuring it is nothing like it too. Memory safety is a key concept nowadays and Gear manages memory like it's nothing. But does it in a way the developer can still feel empowered and in control of the low level mumbo jumbo.

## Who should use Gear?

Gear is a welcoming language that is suited for a variety of individuals and groups. Some examples:

### Students
Students who are learning high-level programming languages tend to run into the same issue. Your code breaks because sometimes you make errors that you didn't know could even happen. Gear is here to help you. With a strict compiler, Gear ensures that your code is safe before you even run it. And unlike other systems languages, Gear is here to help you stay memory safe and NOT use null pointers.

### Individuals
You have a wonderful new project that you're about to add to your folder of previously abandonded billion-dollar unicorns startups. We get it, it happens to everyone. However, Gear is here to change that. With Gear, you can not only maintain productivity and focus on bringing your application to life. But it does it safely and securely.

### Open Source Developers
You have the whole world watching and using your project. Or just that one random guy who stumbled upon it. Either way, your project has to be well maintained and well written when being dished out to potentially hundreds maybe even thousands of developers. Gear helps you do that. With focus on creating error prone software before it's even shipped. Gear ensures you make no silly app-breaking errors and ship it out to many different codebases. Elimitating bugs before they even happen is a key concept in the Gear language and is one of the main ways it ensures safety.
