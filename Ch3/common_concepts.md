# Common Programming Concepts
In this chapter we go over concepts that appear in almost every programming language and how they differ or work in Gear. None of the concepts presented are unique to Gear, but we will go over each part to explain how they work in Gear.

Specifically, we will go over variables, basic types, functions, comments and control flow. These are the foundations of almost every single Gear program.

> **Keywords**<br>
The Gear language has a set of keywords that are reserved for use by the language only, much as in other languages. Keep in mind that you cannot use these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have special meanings, and youâ€™ll be using them to do various tasks in your Gear programs.
